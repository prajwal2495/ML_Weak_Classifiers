## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Make sure your A2 and A8 are correct

A9 utilizes my_DT and my_evaluation in A2 and A8. Make sure they are correct before working on A9.

### Build your own Genetic Algorithm for tuning model parameters

#### Implement every function in [my_GA.py]
Hint: check how [A9.py] utilizes my_GA.py to tune my_DT learner.

### Test my_evaluation Algorithm with [A9.py]
Example output:
```
(base) prajwal@Panda:~/DSCI-633/assignments/assignment9$ python A9.py 
[array([0.9553351 , 0.95858508]), array([0.95626124, 0.95786008]), array([0.95663662, 0.95663662])]
[0.95776608]
```
Results can be quite different due to randomness. You can try executing it multiple times.

## Hint
 - If my_GA.py is too difficult to implement, you can try to complete [my_GA_hint.py].
